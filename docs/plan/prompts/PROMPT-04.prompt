PROMPT 04 OF 04
SCOPE: Execution semantics and safety.

You are working in the local repository "robson".

CONCEPTUAL RATIONALE
Execution is where ideas touch reality.
In trading, this is LIVE trading.
In agentic coding, this is production execution.

The system must be SAFE BY DEFAULT.

TASKS
1) DRY-RUN (default behavior):
   - Full execution simulation.
   - No real orders.
   - Persist execution report.
   - Always allowed.

2) LIVE execution:
   - Requires --live AND explicit acknowledgement flag.
   - Requires successful validation beforehand.
   - Enforce max-orders, max-notional, max-loss.
   - Require explicit client_id context.

3) Policy/Middleware:
   - Allow only approved plan types/modes.
   - Block unsafe combinations early.

DELIVERABLES
- Safe execution flow implemented
- Guardrails enforced
- Audit trail recorded
- Commands to verify behavior locally
