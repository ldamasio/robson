PROMPT 01 OF 04
SCOPE: Establish the CLI foundation and execution contract. Do NOT go beyond this scope.

You are working in the local repository "robson".

IMPORTANT OPERATING RULES
- Modify files locally in the working tree.
- Do NOT create git commits.
- Do NOT push or open PRs.
- I will review all changes manually in Cursor.

CONTEXT AND RATIONALE
Robson is evolving toward an agentic workflow inspired by modern agentic coding principles.
In this model, the CLI is not just a command interface, but a CONTRACT OF INTENT.

Just like in trading, where we separate:
- idea formulation
- validation
- execution

we must separate:
- planning
- validation
- execution

at the CLI level, before any real-world impact happens.

ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS (FIXED)
- main.c must be preserved for historical continuity.
- main.c must become a THIN ROUTER ONLY.
- All real logic must be delegated to an external Go binary ("robson-go").
- "robson" remains the user-facing command.
- Legacy flags (--buy, --sell, etc.) must continue to work.

TASKS
1) Refactor main.c so that:
   - argv[1] is treated as a subcommand (plan, validate, execute, etc.).
   - Legacy flags are translated into subcommands.
   - Execution is delegated via execvp() to robson-go.
   - No business or trading logic exists in C.

2) Create a Go-based CLI (robson-go):
   - Subcommands:
     help, report, say, buy, sell
     plan, validate, execute
   - Clear, human-readable output by default.
   - Optional --json output for automation/agents.

DELIVERABLES
- Updated main.c acting as a router
- Initial robson-go CLI scaffold
- Summary of modified/created files
- Commands to build and smoke-test the CLI

STOP AFTER THIS PROMPT.
