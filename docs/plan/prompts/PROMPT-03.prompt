PROMPT 03 OF 04
SCOPE: Business and risk validation for end-users.

You are working in the local repository "robson".

CONCEPTUAL RATIONALE
In trading, paper trading exists to validate operational reality WITHOUT capital risk.
In agentic coding, validation exists to confirm correctness WITHOUT production impact.

robson validate is the PAPER TRADING stage of the agentic workflow.

It must:
- reduce uncertainty
- expose hidden risks
- block unsafe execution
- increase confidence

This is NOT developer CI.
This is operational and financial validation.

TASKS
1) Implement robson validate:
   - client_id (tenant) must be mandatory.
   - All queries must be explicitly scoped by client_id.
   - Fail validation if tenant context is missing or ambiguous.

2) Risk validation:
   - Validate presence and sanity of risk_config.
   - Enforce invariant rules (drawdown, stop-loss logic, sizing constraints).
   - Explicitly block LIVE execution if invariants are not satisfied.

3) Output:
   - Clear PASS / FAIL result.
   - Enumerated, human-readable reasons.
   - Optional machine-readable output (--json).

DELIVERABLES
- Validation logic in Django
- robson-go invoking validation via management command
- Clear validation report format
