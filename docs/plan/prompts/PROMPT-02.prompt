PROMPT 02 OF 04
SCOPE: Architectural consolidation inside the Django monolith.

You are working in the local repository "robson".

RATIONALE
Robson previously attempted to maintain a separate "hexagonal core" outside Django.
This introduced ambiguity and false promises of decoupling that cannot be fulfilled
given the current runtime, persistence and execution model.

The new principle is:
- ONE system
- ONE runtime
- ONE source of truth

Hexagonal principles remain, but are applied INSIDE Django.

TASKS
1) Identify dependencies on the external core package.
2) Migrate useful logic (e.g. PlaceOrder use case) into Django:
   - Suggested location: api/application or equivalent.
3) Update views to reference the new application-layer code.
4) Ensure persistence uses Django ORM directly.
5) Remove the external core directory once no dependencies remain.

NON-GOALS
- Do not implement trading loops or schedulers.
- Do not add real exchange execution.
- Do not refactor unrelated code.

DELIVERABLES
- Consolidated Django application structure
- External core removed
- Summary explaining what was migrated and why
