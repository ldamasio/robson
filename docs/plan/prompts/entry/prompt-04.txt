You are Claude Code CLI working inside the Robson monorepo.

MISSION
Implement “ENTRY GATING + OPPORTUNITY EXECUTION” as a controlled layer.
Entry happens only if Robson:
- detects a valid technical opportunity
- is available (no conflicting orders)
- has not exceeded monthly loss quota
This layer decides WHEN an entry is permitted, not how to predict price.

REQUIREMENTS
- Add an EntryGate service that checks:
  - max concurrent positions/orders
  - monthly loss limit
  - cooldown after stop-outs
  - market context constraints from MarketContextSnapshot (if available)
- Provide a clear decision output:
  - {ALLOW_ENTRY, DENY_ENTRY} + reasons list
- Must be auditable: log/event with reasons and inputs
- Must integrate with existing strategy detection without refactors.

DELIVERABLES
- Code + tests + docs describing gating rules and configuration.
