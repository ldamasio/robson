# Robson Bot Strategies

**Built-in playful strategies for better trading UX.**

Robson comes with pre-defined strategies designed for different market conditions. Each strategy has a **playful, memorable name** to make trading more intuitive and less intimidating.

## Symbol Scope (ADR-0023)

Every strategy below is **symbol-agnostic**. Each strategy defines its entry logic,
trailing-stop behavior, and risk configuration — **not** its symbol scope. The
operator chooses which symbols a strategy runs on via the strategy's `symbols: [...]`
configuration field. Strategy documentation may use concrete examples
(typically `BTCUSDT`) for clarity, but the rules apply unchanged to any pair the
exchange supports. See
[SYMBOL-AGNOSTIC-POLICIES.md](policies/SYMBOL-AGNOSTIC-POLICIES.md).

## Position-Authorship Invariant (ADR-0022)

Every entry emitted by these strategies passes through the Risk Engine and is
recorded with a `GovernedAction` token. Any exchange position on the operated
account that is not produced by such an entry is UNTRACKED and will be closed by
the reconciliation worker. Strategies do not create a workaround for this
invariant — see
[UNTRACKED-POSITION-RECONCILIATION.md](policies/UNTRACKED-POSITION-RECONCILIATION.md).

## 🎯 Available Strategies

### 1. **All In** 🚀

**Go all-in with technical stop precision.**

- **Type**: Manual entry
- **Timeframe**: 15m
- **Account**: Isolated Margin (3x leverage)
- **Entry Method**: Buy maximum position size with stop at second technical support
- **Risk**: 1% of capital per trade
- **Indicators**: Support/Resistance, Technical Stop

**What it does**: Calculates the optimal position size by working backwards from the technical invalidation level (2nd support on 15m chart). If your stop is far, you get a smaller position. If it's tight, you get a larger position. **Risk stays constant at 1%.**

**Use case**: When you've identified a high-conviction entry and want to maximize position size while keeping risk controlled.

**Command example**:
```bash
# Dry-run: Analyze technical stop and position size
python manage.py technical_stop_buy --capital 100 --strategy "All In"

# Live: Execute buy with technical stop
python manage.py technical_stop_buy --capital 100 --strategy "All In" --live --confirm

# With custom timeframe (4h chart instead of 15m)
python manage.py technical_stop_buy --capital 100 --strategy "All In" --timeframe 4h --live --confirm

# Use 3rd support level instead of 2nd
python manage.py technical_stop_buy --capital 100 --strategy "All In" --level-n 3 --live --confirm
```

**Example output**:
```
=== TECHNICAL STOP ANALYSIS ===
Symbol: BTCUSDC
Current Price: $95,432.10
Technical Stop: $93,500.00 (2nd support on 15m)
Stop Distance: $1,932.10 (2.02%)

=== POSITION SIZING ===
Capital: $100.00
Risk Amount (1%): $1.00
Position Size: 0.000517 BTC
Position Value: $49.35

=== EXECUTION ===
✅ BUY 0.000517 BTC @ $95,432.10
✅ STOP placed @ $93,500.00
✅ If stopped: Loss = $1.00 (exactly 1% of capital)
```

### 2. **Rescue Forces** 🛡️

**Automatic rescue on bullish momentum.**

- **Type**: Automated entry
- **Timeframe**: 15m
- **Account**: Isolated Margin (3x leverage)
- **Entry Conditions**:
  - MA4 crosses above MA9
  - Short-term uptrend confirmed
  - Volume spike confirmation (optional)
- **Risk**: 1% of capital per trade
- **Indicators**: MA4, MA9, Trend, Volume

**What it does**: Automatically enters a position when fast MA (4-period) crosses above slow MA (9-period) with a confirmed short-term bullish trend. The system monitors the market 24/7 and executes when conditions align.

**Use case**: For traders who want to catch early bullish momentum without watching charts all day. Perfect for scalping or short-term trend following.

**How it works**:
1. Pattern detector scans BTCUSDT on 15m timeframe
2. Detects MA4/MA9 crossover
3. Validates short-term uptrend
4. Checks volume spike (if enabled)
5. Calculates position size (1% risk, stop below MA9)
6. Executes buy order automatically
7. Places stop-loss below MA9

**Setup** (via Opportunity Detector):
1. Go to **Opportunity Detector** → **Strategy Configuration**
2. Click **New Configuration**
3. Select **Strategy**: "Rescue Forces"
4. Select **Pattern**: "MA Crossover" (or create custom)
5. Configure:
   - Auto-entry: Enabled
   - Min Confidence: 0.75
   - Timeframes: 15m
   - Symbols: BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT
6. Save

**Manual trigger** (for testing):
```bash
# Scan for Rescue Forces setups
python manage.py scan_patterns --strategy "Rescue Forces" --timeframe 15m

# Execute pending Rescue Forces signals
python manage.py detect_patterns --strategy "Rescue Forces" --auto-execute --live --confirm
```

### 3. **Smooth Sailing** ⛵

**Ride the calm waves of trending markets.**

- **Type**: Trend following
- **Timeframe**: 1h
- **Account**: Spot
- **Entry Conditions**: MA50 crosses above MA200 (Golden Cross)
- **Risk**: 0.5% of capital per trade
- **Indicators**: MA50, MA200

**What it does**: Classic long-term trend following. Enters when the 50-period MA crosses above the 200-period MA (Golden Cross), indicating a strong uptrend.

**Use case**: Conservative spot trading for long-term holders. Lower risk, lower frequency, higher win rate.

**Example**:
```bash
# Setup monitoring for Golden Cross on 1h charts
python manage.py detect_patterns --strategy "Smooth Sailing" --timeframe 1h --symbols BTCUSDT ETHUSDT
```

### 4. **Bounce Back** 🎾

**Catch the bounce when price returns to mean.**

- **Type**: Mean reversion
- **Timeframe**: 30m
- **Account**: Spot
- **Entry Conditions**:
  - Price touches lower Bollinger Band
  - RSI < 30 (oversold)
- **Risk**: 0.5% of capital per trade
- **Indicators**: Bollinger Bands, RSI

**What it does**: Buys when price is oversold (RSI < 30) and touching the lower Bollinger Band, expecting a bounce back to the mean.

**Use case**: Range-bound markets. Works best when there's no strong trend and price oscillates around a mean.

**Example**:
```bash
# Scan for Bounce Back opportunities
python manage.py scan_patterns --strategy "Bounce Back" --timeframe 30m
```
