# robson-frontend

React (Vite) app organized with Ports & Adapters on the client side.

- `src/domain`: pure types and logic
- `src/ports`: interfaces for HTTP/WS/storage
- `src/adapters`: implementations (fetch/WebSocket/localStorage)
- `src/application`: client-side use cases/state orchestration

The previous frontend at `frontends/web/` will be migrated here.
